When considering whether to use open-source or proprietary language models, it is essential to weigh the pros and cons. One significant advantage of open source LLMs is that you retain full control over your data. To make it easier for you to choose an open-source LLM for your company or project, we've summarized eight of the most interesting open-source LLMs available. We've based this list on the popularity signals from the lively AI community and machine learning repository, Hugging Face. 1. GPT-NeoX-20B. 6. The remarkable performance of GPT 4 is due to the massive size of its architecture and the amount of data it was trained on, which costs a lot of money. Few organizations have the hardware resources and funding to support such efforts. Huggingface maintains a leaderboard for tracking open source LLMs. See Open LLM Leaderboad.
